# Calculator using Native Readline module.

## Description
This uses a native module in nodejs called `readline`, all stuff here is native to nodejs.
I really made it like this so i can just run it without having any modules installed

## Prerequisites
* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org)

## Installation
1. Paste the script `index.js` into a file.
1. Run the script by `node <file that you named the thing>`, like `node test.js`
