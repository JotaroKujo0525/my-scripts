How to install railway cli on termux 
**USE THIS IN YOUR OWN RISK**
You don't really need to worry if you won't mess with the file system 

Links:
- [Termux](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/)
- [Andronix](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=studio.com.techriz.andronix)

Not really sure if this is working on all android versions. 

There are 3 steps:
1. Install termux F droid and andronix. Install all of them then proceed to the next step.

2. Installing Ubuntu in termux (not really)
> Open andronix then choose the Ubuntu part, don't use the `Android modded OS`, after that follow the steps on how to make one. Please choose the termux option when installing it. The version I'm using is 18.04

3. Installing railway-cli
> - Start Ubuntu session by using `./start-ubuntu.sh`
> - Paste this in the terminal `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JotaroKujo0525/Termux-railway-cli/main/railway.sh && bash railway.sh`

And that will install the packages needed. *Voila!* Your railway cli is now installed.
